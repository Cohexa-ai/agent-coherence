"""The effect-fence classification — ONE branch table, every surface calls it.

"May this irreversible effect still fire, and if not, WHY" is a safety rule.
It is answered here, once, as a pure function over plain values, so that the
in-process wrapper (``adapters.effect_gate``) and the coordinator route that
answers the same question over HTTP cannot drift apart. A second
implementation of a safety rule is the failure this module exists to remove,
not to add.

Core is the right home: the classification takes only plain values (two version
comparands, two generation comparands, three booleans) and the application
layer already answers a weaker version of this question, so an adapters home
would bar that caller forever.

Shape: :func:`classify_hold` RETURNS a typed reason or ``None`` (proceed), it
never raises for a HOLD — the sibling ``invariants`` module raises because a
violated invariant is a fault, whereas a HOLD is an ordinary, expected answer
the caller must branch on. The one raise here is the drift guard, and it fires
only on a state no leg claimed and the affirmative proceed predicate rejected.

    The branch order is load-bearing and each leg's precedence is pinned by a
    test; changing it changes which reason a caller branches on:

    1. ``input_vanished`` — nothing left to compare against.
    2. ``version_unconfirmed`` — a ``0`` on either side is the "could not
       resolve" sentinel; comparing sentinels as values is how "I do not know"
       becomes "I know it is unchanged".
    3. ``version_moved`` — the value the decision was derived from changed.
    4. ``read_denied`` — the coordinator REFUSED the re-validate read. Fires on
       the refusal ALONE. It once required an unconfirmed generation as well,
       which held only because an in-process strict deny carries no generation;
       a caller that holds the registry's real generation (the coordinator
       route) would have fallen past this leg and either mislabelled its HOLD
       or, with matching comparands, proceeded on a view the coordinator had
       just refused to serve.
    5. ``content_claim_absent`` — the coordinator records no content hash at
       all, so it cannot vouch that these bytes are the content at that
       version. Ordered ABOVE the residual bucket deliberately: both no-claim
       forms must land here, and the all-``f`` form arrives with its generation
       already demoted to ``None``, so a lower position would let it fall into
       ``generation_unconfirmed`` and become byte-identical on the wire to a
       genuinely degraded read — the same reason, hint and retryability for two
       cases whose recovery differs (re-read your bytes vs. call an operator).
    6. ``generation_unconfirmed`` — the residual bucket: a degraded read, an
       unconfirmable out-of-band edit, or a coordinator too old to report
       generations.
    7. ``grant_reclaimed`` — both generations confirmed and they differ: a
       sweep reclaimed the grant the decision was read under, while the version
       never moved.
    8. ``grant_preempted`` — both comparands confirmed AND unchanged, yet the
       re-validate read was served without a standing grant.
