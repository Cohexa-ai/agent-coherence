"""``agent-coherence-replay`` — invariant replay CLI (Unit 5 of D v1).

Two modes share one console script:

1. **Default — invariant replay** (``agent-coherence-replay <session_dir>``):
   walks a captured session directory (manifest.json + per-stream JSONL)
   through the predicate engine and emits human-readable or JSON findings.
2. **``resolve`` subcommand** (Unit 6 of item N v1 / R5b): answers "bytes at
   version k" against a (restarted) coordinator ``.coherence/state.db`` by
   opening it READ-ONLY and calling ``read_at_version`` — the restart-survival
   proof. Additive; the bare positional invocation above is byte-for-byte
   unchanged (see :func:`main` for how the modes are dispatched without the
   subparser shadowing a plain ``<session_dir>`` argument).

Exit-code mapping — the default mode owns ``0–4`` (resolved in plan Open
Question P1-A; mirrors ``docs/proposals/replay_trace_format.md`` §7.3); the
``resolve`` mode DELIBERATELY EXTENDS the space with ``5+`` so a script can tell
a resolve outcome from a replay outcome by exit code alone:

- ``0`` — clean OR all SKIPPED entries are compliance opt-outs
  (``opted_out=True``) declared in ``manifest.streams``; ALSO a resolve WIN
  (retained bytes found at the requested version).
- ``1`` — ≥1 CONFIRMED breach.
- ``2`` — ≥1 SKIPPED with ``opted_out=False`` (manifest declared the
  stream but the file is missing — capture-side bug; surfaces as a
  distinct exit code so CI catches it instead of treating it as clean).
  **Exit 2 is ALSO argparse's usage-error exit code** (missing/unknown/
  mistyped arguments — BOTH modes): argparse exits 2 before either mode's
  handler runs, so a bare exit-2 status is ambiguous between "capture bug"
  and "bad invocation". The streams disambiguate: an argparse error prints
  usage prose to stderr (and, when ``--json`` is among argv, ALSO emits a
  ``{"kind": "error", "exit_code": 2, "reason": "argument_error", ...}``
  envelope on stdout), while a capture-bug exit 2 emits findings output.
- ``3`` — trace error (``MultiInstanceTraceError``, ``TraceCorruptionError``,
  ``ManifestMissingOrUnreadableError``). The exception's message is printed to
  stderr verbatim; tracebacks are caught so partners get the actionable
  next-step pointer instead of Python internals.
- ``4`` — internal error (any other uncaught exception). Decouples CLI bugs
  from CONFIRMED breach (exit 1) so agents triage cleanly. The exception type +
  message land on stderr; Python tracebacks are swallowed. Under ``--json`` an
  error envelope (``exit_code: 4``) is emitted on stdout first, keeping the
  NDJSON stream self-contained on every exit path.

``resolve``-mode exit codes (5+) — one per read-at-version rejection reason and
one per resolver open/lookup error, so a script branches on the code (and the
JSON ``reason`` slug) without parsing prose:

- ``5``  — ``current_version`` rejection (history surface serves history only;
  current bytes are read via the protocol fetch path, never here).
- ``6``  — ``not_retained`` rejection (the version is in range but no servable
  row exists: never captured, K-evicted, or T-expired — deliberately one
  reason).
- ``7``  — ``unknown_artifact`` rejection (the artifact id is unknown to the
  registry; deleted ≡ never-existed).
- ``8``  — ``retention_off`` rejection (retention was never enabled for this
  store).
- ``9``  — ``epoch_mismatch`` rejection (``--expected-epoch`` != the store
  epoch; the store was reset since the caller captured it).
- ``10`` — ``future_version`` rejection (version > current — hints at a second
  coordinator writing the same store).
- ``11`` — resolver CONFIG error: the ``--db`` path is missing (no store
  materialized), OR an ``--instance-id`` cross-check disagreed with the store's
  persisted identity. (Both are caller/config misuse.)
- ``12`` — resolver STORE error: the store needs recovery (hot WAL a read-only
  conn cannot replay), is locked (SQLITE_BUSY), is corrupt (non-sqlite), or is a
  v1/wrong-schema db (read-only mode performs no migration). The JSON ``reason``
  slug distinguishes ``needs_recovery`` / ``db_busy`` / ``db_corrupt`` /
  ``schema_version_mismatch`` so scripts stay precise within this class.
- ``13`` — resolver LOOKUP error: a workspace-path selector matched no
  ``artifacts.name`` row (a by-path miss; distinct from the by-id
  ``unknown_artifact`` rejection above so the two never blur).

A ``ValueError`` from the service (``--version < 1``, caller misuse) is NOT a
resolver reason; ``resolve`` mode surfaces it as exit ``4`` (internal/usage)
with the message on stderr. A ``--output-file`` that names an existing symlink
is refused the same way (exit ``4``): the writer never follows a link, so a
pre-planted symlink cannot redirect retained bytes.

Mode-dispatch escape hatch: the literal first token ``resolve`` always selects
the subcommand, so a session directory literally named ``resolve`` must be
passed with a path spelling — ``./resolve`` (or an absolute path) — which never
matches the bare token and routes to the default replay mode.

Pipe-close handling: ``BrokenPipeError`` (e.g., from ``| head -5``) exits ``0``
in both modes — consumer-closed-pipe is not a failure mode and should not poison
exit-code-driven CI pipelines.

AMBIGUOUS suppression resolved in plan Open Question P1-B: per-finding output
suppresses AMBIGUOUS by default; ``--include-ambiguous`` opts in. Summary ALWAYS
counts AMBIGUOUS, and the callout fires when count exceeds
``--ambiguous-threshold`` (default 10), naming both remedies.

JSON error envelope (Gated #15 resolution): when ``--json`` is active and a
trace error fires (exit 3), a final NDJSON object is written to stdout before
the human prose hits stderr::

    {"kind": "error", "exit_code": 3, "exception": "<ClassName>",
     "message": "..."}

Keeps stdout self-contained for ``--json`` consumers; the stderr line remains
for human log tailing. The pre-flight session-directory check raises
``SessionDirectoryNotFoundError`` (a ``ReplayTraceError`` subclass) so the
envelope logic stays centralized in the outer catch.

Content-safe-by-default (``resolve`` mode security decision, plan Unit 6
Approach): the DEFAULT output (human + ``--json``) carries METADATA ONLY —
``version``, ``coordinator_epoch``, ``captured_at``, ``content_hash``
(sha-256 over the bytes), ``content_length`` — plus a machine-readable
``reason`` on rejection. Retained BYTES reach stdout/a file ONLY via an explicit
``--include-content`` (base64 for BLOB/bytes with a ``content_encoding`` field;
str as-is) or ``--output-file`` (raw bytes, file created at ``0o600``). This is
the first surface piping retained bytes outside the 0600-protected store —
terminals, CI logs, and shell history must not capture secrets by default.

    Mode dispatch (the byte-compat hinge): if the FIRST positional token in
    ``argv`` is the literal ``resolve``, route to the resolve subcommand;
    otherwise run the default invariant-replay path with the unchanged parser.
    Peeking at ``argv`` (rather than wiring ``add_subparsers`` onto the default
    parser) is what keeps a plain ``agent-coherence-replay <session_dir>``
    parsing identical to the pre-Unit-6 CLI — a subparser would otherwise
    consume ``<session_dir>`` as an (invalid) subcommand name.

    Default-mode guards in order of specificity:

    - ``_TRACE_ERRORS + OSError`` (exit 3): the documented corrupted-trace
      family + general read-time IO errors. The full guard wraps load + walk +
      emit because the loader's iterator is lazy: MultiInstance / TraceCorruption
      raise mid-walk, not at ``load()`` time. Catching only ``load()`` would leak
      a traceback when the corruption hides past the manifest.
    - ``BrokenPipeError`` (exit 0): consumer closed the pipe (e.g. ``| head -5``).
      Not a failure; exit cleanly so CI scripts that compose us with pagers /
      line-limiters don't accumulate false positives. The ``__main__`` wrapper
      also guards a residual BrokenPipeError during interpreter shutdown.
    - ``Exception`` (exit 4): anything else uncaught. Surfaces the exception type
      + message on stderr; the traceback is swallowed so partners get an
      actionable signal instead of Python internals. Distinct from exit 1
      (CONFIRMED breach) so agents triage cleanly.
