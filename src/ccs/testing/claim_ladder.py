"""The machine-checked claim ladder (guarantee-ladder plan U7, R-6/KTD-10).

Every guarantee the project claims is a RUNG: a stable slug, the guarantee
text, the exact README claim-phrases it backs (string-pinned), and the pytest
node-ids of the tests that would fail without it. The repo-side meta-test
(``tests/conformance/test_claim_ladder.py``) resolves every node-id at
collection time and drift-guards the pins against the README in BOTH
directions — a claim without a proving test, or a proving test naming a rung
nobody claims, fails CI with the rung named.

The registry ships in the package so a foreign consumer of the conformance
kit sees the rungs and guarantee text; the node-id resolution lives in the
repo test tree only, so importing the kit never inherits repo-local test
references.

**There is deliberately NO cross-host rung.** The single-coordinator boundary
is the ladder's ceiling today; the meta-test asserts the absence so a
cross-host claim can only ever be added together with the tests that earn it.
