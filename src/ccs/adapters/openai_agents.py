# The Coherence Protocol for AI Agents

"""OpenAI Agents SDK coherence adapter.

The adapter's primary durable surface (post-Q6, 2026-05-31) is the **Session
cache**: the OpenAI Agents SDK's ``Session`` is local conversation memory
(``get_items``/``add_items``/``pop_item``/``clear_session``), and a peer that
mutates a shared session leaves this agent's cached view stale — regardless of
how consistent the underlying durable store is. The Q6 probe found the
Conversations *server* consistent, so the coherence value lives here, on the
readers' caches.

The SDK exposes no Session hook/middleware API, so interception is by
*composition*: ``CoherenceSession`` wraps a caller-provided Session, overrides
the four async methods, and routes coherence accounting through
``CoherenceAdapterCore``. Because the underlying Session is supplied by the
caller, this module imports no ``agents`` symbol — it works against anything
implementing the four-method protocol.

Scope (v1): in-process multi-agent coherence — peers registered on one
``CoherenceAdapterCore``/process (the same boundary as the LangGraph/CrewAI/
AutoGen adapters). Cross-service coherence needs the out-of-process coordinator.

    Implements the four-method async protocol by composition. A mutation

    and invalidates peer agents' cached views; ``get_items`` refreshes this
    agent's coherence state so a prior peer mutation surfaces as a cache miss.
    The underlying Session remains the durable source of truth for the items
    themselves — the coherence layer governs *awareness*, not storage.

    Degrade-mode limitation: under ``on_error='degrade'`` a ``CoherenceError`` from a
    mutation is swallowed. ``CoherenceAdapterCore.write`` grants the writer EXCLUSIVE
    and *then* commits as two coordinator steps; if the commit step fails (e.g. a
    concurrent writer reclaimed the grant), the writer can be left holding a stable
    EXCLUSIVE grant with peers already invalidated. That stranded grant is only
    reclaimed by the crash-recovery sweep, which is disabled by default. For
    concurrent-writer workloads on the same session under degrade, enable
    ``CrashRecoveryConfig`` so stranded grants self-heal.
