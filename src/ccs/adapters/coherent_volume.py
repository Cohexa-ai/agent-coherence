"""CoherentVolume — the data-plane coherent-workspace appliance (v1).

v1 prevents the **sequential stale-read→write lost update** for a single-host
agent fleet sharing files in a workspace — the OpenViktor cron shape (agent A
reads v1, agent B reads v1, A commits v2, B's stale write is denied → B
re-reads). It does **not** serialize concurrent racing writers, attach to a
coordinator it did not spawn, or detect an agent that re-reads fresh bytes then
writes a buffer computed from older bytes — those are explicit v1.1 / honest-
boundary cases (see ``docs/plans/2026-06-03-001-feat-data-plane-coherent-workspace-plan.md``
and ``docs/solutions/best-practices/coordinator-invalidation-not-mutex-honest-coherence-claims-2026-06-04.md``).

**Architecture.** CoherentVolume is a thin *out-of-process coordinator client*,
not a wrapper over the in-process :class:`~ccs.adapters.base.CoherenceAdapterCore`.
The teeth that make invalidation enforceable — the strict-mode ``INVALID``-deny —
live in the coordinator HTTP server (``ccs.adapters.claude_code``), so v1 reuses
that shipped path: it writes the policy YAML, spawns/attaches the local-HTTP
coordinator over SQLite-WAL, and routes reads/writes through the ``/hooks/*``
endpoints. Content stays on the real filesystem; the coordinator holds MESI
state + content-hash + version only.

The façade scaffolding (Unit 1) is spawn-with-strict enablement, per-instance
identity (fork-safe), and the fail-closed degrade contract. The sequential
read/write/reacquire contract (Unit 2) builds on it: :meth:`CoherentVolume.read`
registers a SHARED view, :meth:`CoherentVolume.write` acquires EXCLUSIVE (or
fails closed on a stale-view deny), and :meth:`CoherentVolume.reacquire`
recovers from the sticky strict deny. The ``install()`` shim (Unit 3) is next.

# ``AgentRuntime``/``SyncStrategy`` loop (which governs only the in-process
# library path). Bounds TWO independent failure modes, both fail-closed:
#
# - Total commit (CAS POST) attempts is ``MAX_CAS_REACQUIRES + 1`` (initial +
#   retries); on exhaustion ``write_cas`` raises
#   :class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.CasRetriesExhausted` (a typed terminal, never
#   a silent drop). A stale-denied comparand read never POSTs, so it does NOT
#   consume this budget.
# - CONSECUTIVE stale-denied comparand reads are bounded at
#   ``MAX_CAS_REACQUIRES + 1``; on exhaustion ``write_cas`` raises
#   :class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.CoherenceError` (a view that never clears —
#   wedged coordinator / perpetually lagging disk — must not spin). A clean
#   read resets the streak.

class CoherentVolume:
    """Coherent shared workspace for a single-host agent fleet (v1).

    .. warning::

       **An instance is NOT thread-safe — one operation at a time, one instance
       per thread (A5).** ``read``/``write``/``write_cas`` read ``_session_id``
       lock-free while ``reacquire``/``_after_fork`` re-mint it, so overlapping
       calls on a SINGLE instance from different threads could split an in-flight
       CAS across identities. This is misuse, and it is made LOUD: a public op
       that detects another op already in flight on the same instance raises
       :class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.CoherenceError` rather than corrupting
       silently. Each thread (and each forked child) must own its OWN instance —
       per-instance identity is exactly what makes distinct writers distinct. The
       guard is re-entrant for the same thread, so the internal
       ``write_cas`` → ``reacquire`` → ``read`` nesting is unaffected.

    The appliance **spawns** the coordinator for ``root`` and enables strict
    mode on the ``managed`` globs (by writing ``.coherence/tracked.yaml`` and
    ``.coherence/strict_mode.yaml`` before spawn — the coordinator loads policy
    once at startup, so enablement must precede the spawn). Strict mode is what
    gives invalidation teeth: a write from an ``INVALID`` holder is denied, and
    the façade surfaces that deny *fail-closed* so the caller re-reads.

    ``on_error``:

    - ``"strict"`` (default): any coherence failure — a coordinator that is
      unavailable, or one already running that we cannot enable strict on —
      raises :class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.CoherenceError`. Fail-closed.
    - ``"degrade"``: the same conditions warn once
      (:class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.CoherenceDegradedWarning`) and the appliance
      operates best-effort (coherence may be off). Mirrors the other adapters.

    **Fleet requirement (hard, v1).** Every instance coordinating a given
    workspace MUST declare the **same** ``managed`` globs. Strict enforcement is
    verified only coarsely (the coordinator's ``/status`` exposes a strict-pattern
    *count*, not the patterns), so a sibling whose globs **differ** from the
    spawner's passes construction yet its own paths are **not** strict — its stale
    writes then land **with no signal** (``is_degraded`` stays ``False``). A
    precise per-glob check needs coordinator support; until then a
    heterogeneous-globs fleet is unsupported (v1.1).

        **never acquires EXCLUSIVE**: it reads (→ SHARED), derives the bytes via
        ``make_content(current_bytes)``, and commits through the coordinator's
        ``/hooks/post-edit-cas`` version-checked CAS. The winner is elected by
        the coordinator's serialized commit, so two concurrent OCC writers
        cannot both land the same version — the loser is told ``version_mismatch``
        and retries. The pessimistic ``write()`` path is untouched.

        Conflict recovery: on a ``version_mismatch`` / ``other_holder`` conflict
        (or a stale-read deny) the loop re-mints identity (:meth:`_remint` —
        sheds ``INVALID``, but does NOT do reacquire's read; that read would route
        the next comparand read through the coordinator's unchecked *fresh-SHARED*
        branch and re-open the lost update), then on the next attempt does ONE
        hash-checked fresh read whose ``(bytes, version)`` pair is validated,
        re-derives the bytes from that view via ``make_content``, and retries —
        bounded by :data:`MAX_CAS_REACQUIRES`. On exhaustion it raises
        :class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.CasRetriesExhausted` (a typed terminal,
        NEVER a silent drop).

        **Contention bound.** The commit budget is :data:`MAX_CAS_REACQUIRES`
        (=8 → 9 CAS attempts); each lost race (a peer winning the version)
        costs one. Under very high single-host contention — more concurrent
        writers racing the SAME key than the budget — a writer can exhaust it
        and raise :class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.CasRetriesExhausted`. A
        stale-denied comparand read (the transient window where a peer's commit
        landed but its disk write hasn't) does NOT consume the commit budget;
        instead CONSECUTIVE denied reads are separately bounded (also at
        ``MAX_CAS_REACQUIRES + 1``) and raise ``CoherenceError`` if the view
        never clears. Both terminals are the honest fail-closed outcome,
        **never** a silent lost update: the invariant this method guarantees is
        *final == start + every applied delta, OR a typed raise* — a successful
        return always means the update landed.

        ``make_content`` is invoked once per attempt with the freshly-read
        current bytes and returns the bytes to commit — re-deriving the caller's
        intent against the latest state is what makes the retry an *update*
        rather than a stale overwrite. A caller that ignores its ``bytes``
        argument and returns a buffer computed from older bytes defeats the
        guard (the one fundamental OCC-proof boundary; same as :meth:`reacquire`).

        **A deny ALWAYS raises, in both ``on_error`` modes** — including the
        coordinator's fail-closed degrade body
        (``{ok: false, degraded: true, reason: "commit_unconfirmed"}``): a
        degraded CAS is unconfirmed, so it must read as failure (the client must
        never assume the write landed). The SAME fail-closed rule covers a
        mid-commit transport failure that ``degrade`` mode swallowed (``_post``
        returned ``None`` after a version was read): an unconfirmed CAS must
        never write its bytes to disk, so it raises in both modes rather than
        best-effort writing (unconfirmed bytes on disk would re-open the
        lost-update). ``on_error`` still governs whether an infra failure raises
        vs. warns *inside* ``_post`` and the genuinely-unattached
        (``_endpoint is None``) degrade branch above — but never lets an
        unconfirmed OCC commit silently land.

        **Not thread-safe (A5).** Overlapping use of this instance from another
        thread raises ``CoherenceError`` (the single-op guard). The internal
        re-mint + re-read retries run on the SAME thread under the guard already
