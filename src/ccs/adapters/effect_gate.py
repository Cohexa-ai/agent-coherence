"""Effect-ordering gate wrapper (EO-5) -- the builder-facing surface.

``gate()`` is a plain-Python drop-in over a :class:`CoherentVolume` handle:
capture an input's decision-time ``(version, owner_generation)`` pair, run the
caller's decision, re-read the pair at the effect boundary, and fire the
escaping effect only if BOTH are unchanged; else HOLD (raise
:class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.StaleView`) before the effect runs. The two
comparands answer different questions: the version answers "is the value still
the one ``decide`` saw", the ownership generation answers "is the grant it was
read under still standing" -- a sweep reclamation of a stalled holder advances
the generation WITHOUT a version move, which a version-only check cannot see
(the same distinction the read-generation fence draws at the commit seam). One
revocation moves neither comparand: a peer's pessimistic write-acquire ends
the caller's grant with no commit (version unmoved) and no epoch bump
(``trigger="write"`` is deliberately outside ``EPOCH_BUMP_TRIGGERS``), so the
re-validate additionally requires the read that answers it to be served under
a STANDING grant -- a stale-status re-read HOLDs. That re-read travels
``verify_only`` so the coordinator does NOT re-grant the preempted holder on
it; the HOLD is level-triggered, so a bare re-check re-HOLDs until
``reacquire()`` re-mints a live grant rather than silently re-arming the
preempted decision on retry.
It reuses the shipped ``CoherentVolume`` optimistic-concurrency primitives and
never reimplements the coordinator gate.

Honest scope:

- **Escaping effects only.** A pure *write* effect uses
  :meth:`CoherentVolume.write_cas_at` directly -- that is the atomic, no-window
  path; wrapping it here would add nothing over the shipped CAS.
- **Ordering, not rollback** (the gate fires pre-effect and never rolls back).
  For an escaping effect there is a residual re-validate -> fire window this
  layer cannot close (the effect escapes), so the gate *narrows* a stale fire, it
  does not *eliminate* it.
- **Single-host, cooperative opt-in, deny is pull-not-push, correctness first.**
- **Single-artifact read-set.** Gating on several mutually-consistent inputs is
  the shipped in-process ``CoordinatorService.effect_gate`` (a coherent cut), not
  this wrapper.

The HOLD is *raised* (a drop-in guard). Recover with ``volume.reacquire(path)``
for fresh bytes, then re-decide and re-gate.

    """Fire ``effect`` only if ``path`` is unchanged from the version ``decide``
    saw AND the grant it was read under still stands; otherwise raise
    :class:`~ccs.core.exceptions.StaleView` before firing.

    Steps:

    1. Capture ``(bytes, version, owner_generation)`` from ONE
       ``read_with_version_generation`` (the value and both comparands come from
       the same read -- the split-comparand discipline that keeps a
       stale-derived decision from firing).
    2. ``decision = decide(bytes)``.
    3. Re-read the current ``(version, owner_generation)`` at the effect
       boundary. If either moved, the file vanished, or the coordinator could
       not confirm either comparand (a degraded read surfaces version ``0``; an
       older / denying / degraded coordinator surfaces generation ``None``),
       the gate HOLDs: it raises ``StaleView`` carrying
       ``expected_version`` / ``current_version`` and ``expected_generation`` /
       ``current_generation``, and the effect NEVER runs on unconfirmed or
       stale input. The generation leg is what catches the reclaim case: a
       sweep reclaimed this holder's grant (its decision is a zombie's) while
       the bytes -- and so the version -- never moved. The re-read must also
       itself be served under a STANDING grant: a peer's pessimistic
       write-acquire preempts this holder while moving NEITHER comparand (no
       commit yet, and ``trigger="write"`` does not bump the epoch), so a
       stale-status re-read HOLDs even with the pair unchanged.
    4. Otherwise fire ``effect(decision)`` and return its result.

    Escaping effects only, single-host, ordering-not-rollback. The
    re-validate -> fire window is unclosable for an escaping effect. For a write
    effect use ``volume.write_cas_at`` directly.

    Args:
        volume: a ``CoherentVolume`` attached to the coordinator that tracks
            ``path``.
        path: the workspace-relative managed artifact whose
            ``(version, owner_generation)`` pair gates the effect (the
            single-artifact read-set).
        decide: ``(bytes) -> decision`` -- reads the captured bytes and returns a
            decision threaded to ``effect``.
        effect: ``(decision) -> result`` -- the escaping side effect, fired only
            if the input is unchanged at the re-validate point.

    Returns:
        The value ``effect`` returned.

    Raises:
        StaleView: the input moved, vanished, or lost its grant between capture
            and fire, or the capture read was refused before ``decide`` ran
            because the bytes on disk are not the content at the coordinator's
            version (a peer's commit still reaching disk). The effect did not
            run. Recover via ``volume.reacquire(path)`` then re-decide.
        InvariantViolationError: ``volume`` cannot report the grant state of
            its reads, so the fence cannot answer its third leg for it (see
            :func:`_require_grant_state`). A ``CoherentVolume`` always can; a
            duck-typed stand-in must declare both flags. Not a ``StaleView``,
            because no re-read can clear it -- but still under
            ``CoherenceError``, so an existing handler catches it.
