"""CoherentRow — coherence over a Postgres row (native-CAS binding).

Bring coherence to a row you already run in Postgres. The row's ``value`` never
leaves Postgres — the coordinator holds only a monotonic version plus a
fixed-width fingerprint, never the bytes. No-lost-update rides the row's own
version column: a write is ``UPDATE ... SET value = ?, version = version + 1
WHERE id = ? AND version = ?``, so a peer who moved the version wins the race and
the stale writer's ``rowcount`` comes back ``0``.

**The version is minted by the database, not the client.** A confused-deputy-proof
``BEFORE INSERT`` / ``BEFORE UPDATE`` trigger owned by the table owner sets
``NEW.version := OLD.version + 1`` from the *stored* prior row — never a
client-supplied ``NEW.version``. The coherence login role is a dedicated,
non-owner role with only ``SELECT, UPDATE`` on the one table, so it cannot
``ALTER`` the table or disable the trigger to forge a version. :func:`provisioning_sql`
emits the exact DDL + least-privilege grants an operator applies once.

The binding reads ``(bytes, version)`` from a single query — the token and the
bytes it vouches for always come from the same read, so a concurrent update can
never be silently lost across a split read.

Install::

    pip install "agent-coherence[coherent-row]"

The ``psycopg`` (v3) driver is imported lazily, so importing this module without
the driver installed is fine — the clear install error only fires when a
connection is actually needed.

.. note::

   ``xmin`` (Postgres' system row-version) is a *weaker* fallback and is **not**
   shipped here. It is equality-only and 32-bit, so its value can repeat after
   wraparound (or a ``VACUUM FREEZE``) — a repeat is a *missed* conflict, a
   false CAS-pass that silently loses an update. The trigger-managed ``version``
   column is the only version source this binding uses.
