"""Shared-secret authentication for the local HTTP coordinator (KTD-12).

Without this, any same-user process or browser tab can corrupt MESI state
via direct POST or DNS rebinding (browser pages can resolve their own
domain to 127.0.0.1 and bypass same-origin). Suppression of stale-read
warnings is the most direct attack — it would nullify the product's value
silently. ~50 lines of stdlib, no dependency cost.

VERIFIED 2026-05-14 (brainstorm §13.8, §13.9):
- HTTP hook handler accepts arbitrary Authorization headers (axios/1.13.6)
- Bearer secret is REDACTED from `--include-hook-events` debug streams

Threat model:
- Adversary 1: another process running as the same OS user (e.g., a malicious
  npm package, a compromised dev tool). Mitigated by hook.secret being mode
  0600 — only this user can read it.
- Adversary 2: browser tab visiting an attacker page that does DNS rebinding
  to resolve attacker.com → 127.0.0.1. Mitigated by Host-header check
  (browser sends Host: attacker.com, server rejects).
- NOT mitigated: malicious code running with the same UID that ALSO has
  filesystem read of `.coherence/hook.secret`. v0.1 accepts this — it's the
  same trust boundary as the user's shell history, SSH agent socket, etc.

# the coordinator mints and binds to ONE acting identity on that identity's
# first claim (``POST /principal/claim``); a request naming the identity
# presents it in :data:`CALLER_PRINCIPAL_HEADER`. What it buys depends on the
# caller (plan KTD5):
#
# - a LONG-LIVED caller (``CoherentVolume``, a direct client) mints once and
#   holds the principal in memory for its lifetime: it never looks a principal
#   up by the identity it names, so it cannot present another identity's by
#   accident. That is accident-resistance, not unreadability — the coordinator
#   stores every principal it issued in ``.coherence/state.db``, which any
#   process of the same OS user can read;
# - a ONE-SHOT caller (the hook client: one process per hook event) can keep it
#   only on disk, in this ``0700`` directory, keyed by the identity it claims.
#   Any process that can read ``.coherence/`` can read it for any identity.
#   There the principal buys convention-enforcement and a detectable unbound
#   caller — never separation between callers of the same OS user.
#
# The nonce file is created once, exclusively, and never replaced or removed:
# it is what proves a later claim is a retry of the first (R20). The principal
# file is a cache of what a claim presenting that nonce returned, so it IS
# replaced — atomically, and only with such a claim's answer — when the
# coordinator no longer holds the value it caches (its store was reset) or the
