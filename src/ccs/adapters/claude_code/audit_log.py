"""Minimal deny-site audit log — appends strict-mode denial events as
JSONL to ``<coordinator_root>/.coherence/audit.log`` (v0.2 plan Unit 4,
KTD-V compressed).

Why a separate module:
- Single-responsibility helper that the 4 strict-deny call sites import.
- Easier to test in isolation without spinning a full coordinator.
- Future v0.2.x callback-surface plan (deferred per plan § Deferred to
  Separate Tasks) can layer atop this without changing call-site code.

KTD-V minimal-scope invariants (security review 2026-05-21):
- **Denial events only.** No warn-mode entries, no allow events.
  ``decision`` is always ``"strict_deny"`` in v0.2.
- **No schema_version field.** Adding it now would lock the schema; the
  v0.2.x callback surface design will introduce versioning when there's
  a real consumer.
- **Bounded payload.** No Bash command bodies, no tool input strings,
  no user content. Only path / session_id / tool name / ISO timestamp /
  decision marker. Test ``test_audit_log_payload_bounded_no_user_content``
  guards against accidental field expansion.
- **0o600 file mode.** Created with explicit mode flag. Mode drift on
  an existing file (operator chmod 0644) is logged as a warning + bumped
  on a counter; the append still proceeds because the data is denials-
  only metadata, not credential material.

Concurrent writes: ``os.O_APPEND`` is atomic for small writes on POSIX
(per the kernel; the write syscall is serialized between concurrent
appenders). One JSONL line per write keeps each append atomic — no
locking needed at the application layer.
