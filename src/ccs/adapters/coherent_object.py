"""CoherentObject — coherence over an S3 object (native-CAS binding).

Bring coherence to an object you already keep in S3. The object body never
leaves S3 — the coordinator holds only a monotonic version plus a fixed-width
fingerprint, never the bytes. No-lost-update rides S3's own conditional write:
a write is ``put_object(Body=..., IfMatch=prior_etag)``, so a peer who moved the
object's ETag wins the race and the stale writer's put fails with ``412
PreconditionFailed``.

**The version is the object's ETag, minted by S3, captured from the write
response.** The binding holds zero version state and never computes the ETag —
under SSE-KMS/SSE-C, multipart, or a directory bucket the ETag is not a content
digest, so it is treated as an OPAQUE token. It is also NOT portable across
artifact refs: identical bytes elsewhere can mint an identical ETag, so a token
for one key must never arbitrate a write to another.

The binding reads ``(bytes, ETag)`` from a single ``get_object`` — the token and
the bytes it vouches for always come from the same response, so a concurrent
update can never be silently lost across a split read (never Head-then-Get for
the pair).

Install::

    pip install "agent-coherence[coherent-object]"

The ``boto3`` driver is imported lazily, so importing this module without the
driver installed is fine — the clear install error only fires when a real client
is actually built (a caller may instead inject a client at construction).

**Writes are single-request puts, structurally.** The binding writes via
``put_object`` exclusively — never the multipart API or boto3's transfer manager
— so ``put_object``'s 5 GiB request ceiling is the size bound. This is what keeps
the ETag round-trip and the conditional-write semantics well-defined.

**Workspace-Versioning axes (ADDITIVE, 2026-08-08).** On a versioned bucket the
binding also captures the S3 **versionId** — strictly as the manifest/restore
POINTER, never as a comparand: **the ETag remains the only CAS comparand** (the
F4 pointer-vs-comparand split). One read yields ``(bytes, ETag, versionId)``
from ONE response (:meth:`CoherentObject.read_versioned`); a restore reads
pinned history (:meth:`CoherentObject.read_pinned`); the restore write leg is
still an If-Match put whose win now also reports the freshly minted versionId
(:meth:`CoherentObject.cas_write_versioned`). The ``"null"`` versionId an
unversioned bucket reports (and an absent one) is a SENTINEL: it never compares
equal to a usable pointer and can never seed a pinned read — both surface the
typed :class:`VersionPointerUnconfirmed` (UNCONFIRMED → HOLD). Every released
pre-WV signature and behavior is unchanged.
