---------------------------- MODULE Snapshot ----------------------------
(* Consistent multi-artifact snapshot-session amendment to the bounded-
   retention fenced MESI protocol. Proves that a session which captures a
   version-vector across SEVERAL artifacts at ONE linearization point
   (begin_session) reads a coherent cut -- no cross-artifact READ SKEW -- and
   that the versions it pins are held against the K-bounded GC for the
   session's lifetime (the exemptions seam), without disturbing any inherited
   safety invariant.

   Plan: docs/plans/2026-06-26-002-feat-read-side-transaction-snapshot-plan.md
   (Unit 1). Detailed spec: docs/brainstorms/2026-06-14-sb17-snapshot-sessions-v1-requirements.md.
   Origin (read-side, EO-4 = SB-17 = TX-1). Composes with Retention via EXTENDS.

   THE PROBLEM. With only the inherited single-artifact reads, an agent that
   reasons over several artifacts stitches N independent reads. A peer commit
   can land between read 1 and read N, so the agent observes artifact A at the
   version it had at t1 and artifact B at the version it had at t2 > t1, with a
   commit in between -- a snapshot that corresponds to NO single instant of the
   global version vector (cross-artifact read skew). The fix is a CONSISTENT
   CUT: capture every artifact's version at ONE atomic linearization point.

   Adds:
     - snapshot     : per-session captured version-vector, [Sessions ->
                      [Artifacts -> (1..MaxVersion) \cup {None}]]. A live
                      session's entry is a full capture (no None); a dead
                      session's entry is all-None. The pin map.
     - sessionLive  : [Sessions -> BOOLEAN]. Session liveness -- a STATE
                      COMPONENT THE GC READS (R4): a pinned version is exempt
                      from collection only while its session is live.
     - readSkew     : a sticky history flag -- TRUE iff any commit ever
                      interleaved a session that was only PARTIALLY captured
                      (some artifacts pinned, others not). Under the atomic
                      capture (correct spec) a session is never partial, so the
                      flag is unreachable-TRUE; the documented split mutant
                      makes it reachable. Mirrors the staleApply / collectedRead
                      idiom: the flag flips only when the modeled implementation
                      would have read a skewed cut; the correct spec never sets
                      it.
     - BeginSessionAction : the ATOMIC cut capture -- a not-live session pins
                      the CURRENT version of every artifact in ONE step.
                      Non-mutating: no MESI grant, no version bump, no fence
                      capture, no history change (UNCHANGED retentionVars).
     - EndSessionAction   : release the pins (sessionLive -> FALSE); the pinned
                      versions become collectible again (R4 liveness gate).
     - SnapshotCommitAction : RetentionCommitAction with the pin-aware GC
                      (SnapRetainAndCollect) PLUS the read-skew detector.
                      Replaces the inherited RetentionCommitAction.

   KEY MODELING DECISION (the crux). Retention's crux is that retain + bump +
   GC are ONE action (same-transaction), and mutant recipe 5 splits them to
   expose the crash window. Snapshot mirrors it for the READ side: the cut
   capture is ONE atomic action over ALL artifacts, so the correct spec can
   NEVER reach a state where a session is partially captured. The read-skew
   detector therefore lives in an action that is ALWAYS present -- the commit
   (SnapshotCommitAction sets readSkew TRUE when it interleaves a partially-
   captured session) -- and is vacuous in the correct spec because partial
   captures are unreachable. The MUTANT (README) splits BeginSessionAction into
   per-artifact CaptureArtifactAction steps; partial captures become reachable,
   a commit can interleave one, and TLC finds the NoReadSkewWithinCut violation.
   We model atomic capture STRUCTURALLY (one action), not by deleting a
   precondition -- exactly as the plan-review required.

   THE EXEMPTIONS SEAM (R14, bounded-exemptions GC-safety). A live session's
   pinned version must survive the K-bounded GC even after the retention window
   has slid past it -- the implementation's collectible_versions(exemptions=...)
   excludes pinned versions from collection. SnapRetainAndCollect keeps
   (newest-K window) UNION (versions pinned by live sessions). A pin is never
   collected while its session is live (PinAlwaysRetained), and the history can
   exceed K by at most the number of live sessions -- the BOUNDED-exemptions
   property the relaxed SnapshotTypeOK pins (Cardinality <= MaxRetained +
   |Sessions|). The window-union-exempt GC preserves NoCollectedRead by
   construction (it only KEEPS MORE than the window, never less). Mutant recipe
   10 (README) makes the GC ignore exemptions and TLC finds a pinned version
   collected out from under a live session (PinAlwaysRetained violation).

   DELIBERATELY OUT OF MODEL:
     (a) WRITE SKEW (R5) -- two sessions each reading a coherent cut and each
         committing one artifact can still violate a cross-artifact application
         invariant. That is SB-18 (atomic multi-artifact write), out of this
         plan. This spec proves READ-skew freedom only; the model has only
         single-artifact commits, so it asserts nothing about cross-artifact
         write atomicity.
     (b) the session-read SERVE path and session.commit -- the session reads
         from the pin (a pure lookup of snapshot[s]) and commits via the
         inherited version-CAS; neither adds protocol state. Their correctness
         is the runtime units' (plan Units 3/4) and is owned by the Python
         suite. This spec models the CUT and its GC-safety, which is what the
         protocol-level invariants can express.
     (c) coordinator restart / durability -- inherited exclusion (in TLA the
         state IS the durable truth). Restart-survival of pins is sqlite-only
         and is an implementation/test property (plan R6 / Unit 9).

   WHAT IS PROVEN: safety PRESERVATION -- every inherited invariant
   (SingleWriter, MonotonicVersion, the CR I3-I6 family, NoStaleApply,
   NoCollectedRead, ReadGenBounded) re-checked with the session machinery
   composed in, PLUS NoReadSkewWithinCut and PinAlwaysRetained. NOT proven:
   behavioral equivalence (no refinement mapping). LIVENESS is discharged as
   safety + prose per the repo's safety-only TLC convention (README). *)
