------------------------------- MODULE OCC -------------------------------
(* Optimistic-concurrency commit-CAS amendment to the MESI + crash-recovery
   protocol. Models a version-checked commit (commit_cas) that closes the
   concurrent lost-update the pessimistic write path leaves open.

   Plan: docs/plans/2026-06-08-001-feat-occ-write-api-same-host-v1-plan.md
   (Unit 1). Composes with CrashRecovery via EXTENDS.

   Adds:
     - observedVersion : the version each agent last read (its expected_version)
     - lostUpdate      : a sticky history flag — TRUE iff any commit_cas ever
                         succeeded on a stale observed version (a lost update)
     - ObserveAction   : an S/I agent reads the current version into its slot
     - CommitCASAction : optimistic commit — succeeds iff observed == current
                         AND there is no other M/E holder; else a clean no-op
                         conflict (no mutation, no silent drop).

   KEY MODELING DECISION (the crux). OCC writers stay in S/I and NEVER acquire
   EXCLUSIVE. So two concurrent OCC writers are *both* S; the version check
   elects exactly one winner and the loser observes a version_mismatch. We do
   NOT model two simultaneous EXCLUSIVE holders — that is a SingleWriter
   violation and not how OCC works. OCC-vs-pessimistic coexistence IS modeled:
   an inherited CRWriteAction can put a peer in E, and the OCC commit then sees
   `other_holder` (the `otherHolder` guard).

   LIVENESS is discharged as safety + prose (founder-resolved; see plan Key
   Decisions). TLC checks the NoLostUpdate safety invariant only; bounded
   progress is a prose argument (each OCC-vs-OCC conflict is a version_mismatch,
   so the version advanced => some writer committed => system-wide progress is
   monotonic). No temporal / fairness property is checked — consistent with the
   repo's safety-only TLC convention (README: "Full liveness proofs" out of
   scope).

   A winning commit_cas leaves the committer in SHARED, not MODIFIED: an OCC
   writer holds no grant (it never acquired EXCLUSIVE), so SHARED is the honest
   end-state and lets the same agent immediately re-observe + re-commit. Because
   no OCC transition ever enters M/E, the inherited CrashRecovery.GrantUpdate
   suffices (peers leaving M/E on invalidation drop their tick; the committer's
   S->S preserves) — no override is needed. *)
