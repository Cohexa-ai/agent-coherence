---------------------------- MODULE Retention ----------------------------
(* Bounded version-retention amendment to the fenced MESI protocol.
   Proves that retaining a K-bounded history of committed versions, and
   serving read-at-version requests from it, changes NOTHING about the
   coordinator protocol: every inherited safety invariant (single-writer,
   monotonic versioning, the crash-recovery I3-I6 family, NoStaleApply)
   is re-checked with retention enabled, and a versioned read is proven
   to be a protocol no-op.

   Plan: docs/plans/2026-06-10-001-feat-version-retention-read-at-version-plan.md
   (Unit 1). Origin: the 2026-06-10 version-retention requirements brief
   (docs/brainstorms/).
   Models R4 (GC invisible, current never collectible), R6 (fence
   non-capture), R7 (off-protocol read), R8 (this spec), and the atomic
   half of R3 (capture happens atomically at commit).

   Adds:
     - history       : per-artifact map version -> retained content marker.
                       Content is abstracted as the version number itself:
                       within a behavior the content at (artifact, version)
                       is unique (monotonic versions, one committer per
                       version), so the marker is distinct per version yet
                       deterministic. A richer marker (e.g. the writer id)
                       would only add a decorative state-space dimension --
                       no checked property reads the marker value -- and
                       measured against the Fencing_CI budget that dimension
                       is what blows the CI gate. Real byte payloads are
                       out of the question for the same reason.
     - collectedRead : a sticky history flag -- TRUE iff a versioned read
                       ever observed a hole inside the K-window strictly
                       below the current version, i.e. the service would
                       have had to answer for a version the bounded-
                       retention contract promises is servable but which
                       was collected (or never retained). Mirrors the
                       staleApply / lostUpdate idiom: the flag flips only
                       when the modeled implementation would have done the
                       wrong thing; the correct spec never sets it.
     - MaxRetained   : the K bound. K counts retained rows INCLUDING the
                       current version's row; the current version is never
                       collectible (R4). Mirrors RetentionPolicy.max_versions.
     - RetentionCommitAction : FencingCommitAction + atomic retain + inline
                       K-GC (see crux below).
     - VersionedReadAction   : a read-at-version request -- a pure protocol
                       no-op (see below).

   KEY MODELING DECISION (the crux). Fencing's crux is that a SINGLE
   FencingCommitAction models BOTH the pessimistic commit and the OCC
   commit_cas, because the fence guard is uniform across both paths. The
   retention capture inherits that uniformity: the implementation retains
   inside the SAME sqlite transaction / same GIL-atomic apply step as the
   commit it captures, on every capture point. So Retention REPLACES the
   one FencingCommitAction with RetentionCommitAction: identical guard,
   identical protocol effect, PLUS extend history with the new version and
   apply inline K-GC -- commit + retain + GC are ONE action, atomic by
   construction. Per-capture-point coverage (pessimistic vs commit_cas vs
   register_artifact) is discharged by the Python parity suite, not TLC.
   Mutant recipe 5 (README) splits the retain from the bump into two
   separately-interleavable actions -- the exact crash window the
   same-transaction discipline excludes -- and TLC then finds the
   NoCollectedRead violation.

   THE READ IS A PROTOCOL NO-OP -- and how that is checked. The
   implementation's read_at_version never calls set_agent_state /
   set_agent_transient: no MESI transition, no invalidation membership,
   no read_generation capture (R6/R7 hold by construction there).
   VersionedReadAction models this: it leaves EVERY protocol variable
   unchanged (base MESI vars, crash-recovery vars, ownerGeneration,
   readGeneration, staleApply). Structural UNCHANGED alone is not
   checkable evidence, though: a mutated read that refreshes the reader's
   readGeneration produces transitions extensionally identical to a
   legitimate ObserveGenAction, so no state invariant (NoStaleApply
   included) can see it. The no-op claim is therefore checked as an
   explicit TLC ACTION PROPERTY:

       ReadAtVersionIsProtocolNoOp ==
           [][VersionedReadAction => UNCHANGED fenceVars]_retentionVars

   TLC evaluates [][A]_v action properties on every explored transition
   (cheap, no liveness graph), so mutant recipe 6 -- the fence-refreshing
   read -- has a defined failure signal: the property fires even though
   NoStaleApply stays green. The alternative encoding (a ghost variable
   capturing pre/post fence-state equality) was rejected because it adds a
   state dimension; the action property adds none.

   MODELING SCOPE OF THE READ. The reader carries NO agent binding: on
   this path the requester has no protocol identity (R7) -- the read's
   effect (none) is the same for every agent. Mutant recipe 6 reintroduces
   an agent binder to express the fence-refresh bug. The requested version
   ranges over ServableHistory(art): the K-window STRICTLY below the
   current version -- the only requests whose answer depends on retention
   state. Requests outside it -- at the current version (R5
   current_version rejection), below the window (honest not_retained for
   a legitimately collected version), or above the current version
   (future_version) -- are structurally identical typed rejections with
   the same empty effect and can never flip the flag even in mutants;
   enumerating them would only add stutter transitions and TLC time, so
   the Python request-surface tests (plan Unit 4) own them.

   K=1 CAVEAT. With MaxRetained = 1 the window strictly below the current
   version is empty, so the read action is never enabled, collectedRead
   can never flip, and the flag has no teeth (the GC also never has a
   non-current row to drop). Both cfgs therefore use MaxRetained = 2,
   which keeps K-eviction reachable inside the version bound AND gives
   mutants 5/7/8 a violation to find. The ASSUME below only enforces the
   implementation floor (max_versions >= 1, RetentionPolicy.__post_init__).

   DELIBERATELY NOT MODELED (one-line whys; README out-of-scope table):
     (a) artifact delete -- Artifacts is a CONSTANT throughout the module
         chain; delete-drops-history (cascade) is owned by Python tests.
     (b) register_artifact -- no register action exists in the chain; the
         initial state retains version 1, covering the trivial case.
     (c) retention-policy changes across runs -- MaxRetained is a per-run
         CONSTANT; a re-opened store is equivalent to a fresh bounded store.
     (d) coordinator restart / durability -- inherited exclusion from
         Fencing (in TLA the state IS the durable truth); restart-survival
         of retained rows is an implementation/test property (replay
         resolver, plan Unit 6).

   KNOWN SIBLING GAP (do not over-claim): the implementation's
   trigger="timeout" transient eviction does NOT bump owner_generation;
   only the crash-recovery sweep triggers (heartbeat / max_hold) do. This
   spec models exactly the sweep that Fencing models and claims no
   eviction coverage beyond it.

   WHAT IS PROVEN: safety PRESERVATION -- the inherited invariants still
   hold with the retention machinery composed in, plus NoCollectedRead and
   the read-no-op action property. NOT proven: behavioral equivalence to
   Fencing (that would need a refinement mapping; deliberately out of
   scope). LIVENESS is discharged as safety + prose per the repo's
   safety-only TLC convention (README). *)

   identical empty-effect rejections that can never flip the flag -- even

(* Retain newVer and apply inline K-GC in one step: extend the map, then
   drop the oldest row iff the row count exceeds MaxRetained (row-count
   semantics, matching collectible_versions in the implementation). A
   single drop suffices: every extend adds exactly one row to a map the
   GC already bounded at MaxRetained, so the domain never exceeds
   MaxRetained + 1 in any reachable state -- including under the README
   mutants, whose retain steps also GC in-step. The drop selects the
   OLDEST row, so with MaxRetained >= 1 the GC can NEVER drop the newest
   (current) version -- R4's "current never collectible" holds by
   construction. Mutant recipe 7 (README) flips the selection to the
   newest row, making the current version collectible. *)

   rejection, never by history) whose row is absent -- collected or never
