"""Session handoff — loss first, then guarded: two sessions on one host, one shared notes file.

Runs five acts, each with two REAL OS processes, and exits 0 only if ALL hold:
  - RED       — plain file I/O → A's second write erases B's pickup line; nothing raised.
  - GREEN     — the same sequence through ``CoherentVolume`` → A's stale write is
                DENIED (``StaleView``); A reacquires and both lines survive EXACTLY.
  - CONTROL   — the green code with the guard pointed elsewhere → the loss returns,
                proving green depends on the deny, not on the re-read.
  - HANDOFF a — A checkpoints, writes once more, stops; B restores → the disk rewinds
                in one attempt and A learns on its NEXT write (denied, then reacquire).
  - HANDOFF b — A is STILL WORKING while B restores → the restore concludes a bounded
                ``conflict``; A's latest edit survives; nothing was clobbered.

Constructed, deterministic, offline (a local coordinator; loopback only, no network).

    python -m examples.session_handoff.main

Every session is a spawned child that re-imports this module, so all work stays
under the ``__main__`` guard at the bottom.
