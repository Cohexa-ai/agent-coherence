"""HANDOFF: A hands work to B through a checkpoint, and the rewind has two outcomes.

Both acts open the same way. A posts its status to the shared notes file,
checkpoints it (``handoff-1`` / ``handoff-2``), and keeps working: one more
status write. B picks the checkpoint up and restores it, rewinding the notes to
the handoff point. What happens next depends on one thing — whether A has
stopped.

HANDOFF-a (``run_handoff_stopped``): A stopped after that last write. B's
restore lands cleanly (``restored``, one attempt) and the disk holds the handoff
bytes again. A finds out only when it next writes: the restore went through the
versioner's own ledger, never through A's live coordinator view, so A's next
``write`` re-hashes the disk against the hash it last observed, sees a foreign
change, and is DENIED (``StaleView``). A ``reacquire``s and reads the handoff
bytes. Restoring file members while a live session runs bypasses its grants —
the session learns on its next access.

HANDOFF-b (``run_handoff_racing``): A is STILL WORKING while B restores. Every
read the restore takes is followed by one more edit from A, so the restore's
version-CAS is beaten each time (the disk no longer matches what the ledger just
observed), re-drives from a fresh read, and is beaten again — until the bounded
re-drive budget exhausts into ``conflict``. A's latest edit survives on disk,
nothing was clobbered, and B is told. The surprising half: a restore is not an
overwrite.

Sequenced, not raced: the racing source stands in for A's continued edits
deterministically, one edit per restore read. Each session is a real OS process
(see ``sessions.py``): the first spawns the coordinator, the second attaches.
