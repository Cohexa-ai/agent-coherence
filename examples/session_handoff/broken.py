"""RED: the handoff as people actually run it — plain file I/O, no coordination.

Session A is mid-task and posts its status to the shared notes file. Teammate
B picks up: reads the notes and appends its pickup line. A — still working,
and never re-reading — writes its updated status from the notes it read
earlier. B's line is gone, and nothing complained. That is the lost update
over a shared scratch file, here across two REAL OS processes; ``fixed.py``
runs the same sequence through ``CoherentVolume`` and shows it denied and
recovered.

This module also hosts the small story vocabulary the other acts reuse
(``EXPECTED``, ``new_workspace``, ``render_notes``, ``verdict_line``) so every
act renders its trace the same way.

Deterministic and offline — sequenced, not raced.
