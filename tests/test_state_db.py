"""The shared read-only open, and the two promises it makes to both readers.

``ccs.diagnose._state_db`` is the one place the offline readers open a
coordinator ``state.db``, so its two guarantees are theirs: the handle is
read-only, and a failure is loud. Both are stated in prose the readers repeat
to their callers, and neither was pinned by a test — the readers' own suites
build every path from ``tmp_path``, whose components never carry a character
the URI layer treats as syntax.

That gap hid a real defect. The store path is interpolated into a SQLite URI
whose query string is the only thing that makes the handle read-only, so a path
containing ``#``, ``?`` or ``%`` was parsed as URI syntax rather than as
filename bytes: SQLite opened a different file, ``mode=ro`` was displaced into
the fragment and silently lost, and ``read_conflict_totals`` answered ``{}`` for
a store that held real conflicts. A fabricated zero is the exact failure this
subsystem exists to prevent, and the suite stayed green through all of it.
