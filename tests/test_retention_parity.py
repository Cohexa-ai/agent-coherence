"""Cross-registry retention parity — the genuinely net-new Unit 5 scenarios.

Plan item N v1, Unit 5 (``docs/plans/2026-06-10-001-feat-version-retention-
read-at-version-plan.md``). Requirement trace: **R3** (parity), suite-wide
success criteria.

This file is DELIBERATELY SMALL. Units 2-4 already established extensive
both-registry coverage:

- ``tests/test_retention.py`` runs a parametrized ``retention_registry`` fixture
  (in_memory + sqlite) over per-capture-point capture, K-eviction, T-expiry,
  ``content=None`` skip, no-capture-on-reject, and remove-drops-history.
- ``tests/test_read_at_version.py`` runs a parametrized ``make_registry`` factory
  (in_memory + sqlite) over the full per-reason matrix, fence non-capture (R6),
  MESI non-interaction (R7), and the rejection-payload pin.

Unit 5 adds ONLY the two cross-registry scenarios those per-unit suites do not
cover, because each runs one closure against one arm at a time rather than
asserting the two arms agree as a whole:

1. **Whole-sequence equivalence** (``TestWholeSequenceEquivalence``) — one
   identical operation sequence (register → K-evicting commits → delete-cascade
   → ``commit_cas(content=None)`` skip → T-expiry via a monkeypatched clock) run
   against BOTH registries built as a pair (the ``tests/test_registry.py:195``
   ``_build_pair`` / ``_normalize`` pattern), asserting the observable retention
   state — retained ``(version → content)`` maps (str AND bytes) and
   ``read_at_version`` ``(version → outcome)`` maps — is IDENTICAL across
   registries. This is the test that catches sqlite and in-memory DRIFTING
   apart; no per-unit test compares the two arms' full state.

2. **Peer-interleaving parity** (``TestPeerInterleavingParity``) — a second
   writer commits a new version BETWEEN this reader's operations; the reader's
   next ``read_at_version`` must reflect the AUTHORITATIVE persisted history, not
   a stale per-instance cached belief. This guards the exact bug class in
   ``docs/solutions/logic-errors/coherent-volume-write-noop-skip-stale-cache-
   disk-divergence-2026-06-08.md`` (an optimization that consulted a per-instance
   cache instead of the authoritative store → silent divergence). The sqlite arm
   is the REAL two-handle case (two ``SqliteArtifactRegistry`` handles on one db
   file); the in-memory arm is single-object (two handles is N/A) and instead
   proves the read path re-derives from the one authoritative store after a peer
   mutation. Per the ``tests/test_occ_commit_cas.py`` discipline the only HARD
   assertion is the correctness property; concurrency-realism is a
   ``RuntimeWarning`` and a ``threading.Barrier`` forces the window.

Reason matching is ALWAYS ``reason == CONSTANT`` against the imported wire-stable
constants — never a substring of a human message (the
typed-signal-not-substring house rule).
