"""Tests for the effect-fence classification (``ccs.core.fence``).

This is the branch table that decides whether an irreversible effect may still
fire. It used to live inside the in-process wrapper's message builder, where a
second surface answering the same question had no way to reach it — and a
second implementation of a safety rule is the drift this module exists to
remove. These tests pin the rule at its new home, by typed REASON IDENTIFIER
rather than by message text, and they exercise input shapes the in-process path
can never produce (a refused read carrying a real integer generation) because
those are exactly the shapes a coordinator route hands it.

Core-layer tests live FLAT in this repo (``test_invariants.py``,
``test_states.py``, ``test_types.py``); this file follows them.
