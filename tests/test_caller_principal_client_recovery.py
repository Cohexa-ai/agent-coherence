"""The one-shot clients' caller-principal recovery (caller-principal plan R20).

The hook client keeps a session's mint nonce and principal on disk under
``.coherence/`` — one process per invocation leaves it no other place.
(``agent-coherence-status --self-test`` does not: it runs as one process and
holds fresh sessions' principals in memory.) A request the coordinator refuses with
a typed ``caller_principal_foreign`` / ``caller_principal_absent`` reason is
recovered by re-claiming with the SAME stored nonce: a principal that differs
from the one presented replaces the stored file (write-then-rename, 0600) and
the refused request is retried ONCE; the same principal, a claim bound under
another nonce, or a claim that does not confirm is reported and stops; a 404
retries once without the header. Nothing re-mints, nothing deletes the nonce,
and nothing prints a principal or a nonce.

What this buys on the hook surface is accident-resistance and a detectable
unbound caller, not separation between callers: every one of these files is
readable by any process of the same OS user.
