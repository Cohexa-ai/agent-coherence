"""U3 — the offline foreign-write report and its four distinguishable states.

The sibling conflict-counter reader deliberately maps an absent table and an
empty one to the same value, and documents that as "zero recorded conflicts".
This reader cannot: a coverage claim is gated on the detector having actually
observed a span, so reading a store where it never ran as a clean zero is the
one failure the instrument exists to prevent. Hence four states, and a
discriminator that keys on the observation ROW rather than on the table — all
three tables are created on every writer open, including one whose sweep thread
was never started.
