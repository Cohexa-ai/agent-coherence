"""``swg_gate`` — the pull-based effect fence on the MCP tool surface.

``gate()`` cannot be a tool: its ``decide``/``effect`` are Python callables, and
an MCP agent's decision and effect live between tool calls, outside this
process. So the agent carries the ``(version, owner_generation)`` pair from its
``swg_read`` and pulls a verdict here immediately before dispatching something
irreversible. These tests drive the sync ``_do_*`` helpers against a real
loopback coordinator, matching the Unit-4 harness.

The headline is the reclaim leg: the grant the agent read under is reclaimed
while the bytes never move, so the VERSION still matches and only the
generation reveals it. That is the exact case the version-only surface could
not see.
