"""``swg_read`` when the coordinator answers the pre-read with a failure.

Two coordinator-side failures answer a pre-read as HTTP 200 ``{ok: false,
reason: "internal: <Type>"}``: the caller-principal gate's store read raising
(a bound session whose binding is not cached — what a coordinator restart
leaves — under a locked registry) and the pre-read work body raising. Neither
confirms the read was registered (a body raise can fail after part of it was),
so the server's strict volume must fail it closed and the
tool call must answer a non-ignorable deny, never content: a read the agent
takes for registered is one a peer's later commit invalidates nothing for,
and the agent's next write lands over it. Driven through the sync ``_do_*``
helpers against a coordinator running in THIS process so its registry can be
made to fail, as the volume's own tests do.
