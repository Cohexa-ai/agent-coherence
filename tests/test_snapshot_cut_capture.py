"""Unit 2 — atomic consistent-cut capture + pin-set store (SB-17 / TX-1).

Plan: ``docs/plans/2026-06-26-002-feat-read-side-transaction-snapshot-plan.md``
Unit 2. Requirement trace: **R1** (atomic cut), **R4** (pins held against GC),
**R6** (restart-survival sqlite-only — asserted in the parity suite), **R11**
(the cut is an INSPECTABLE ``{artifact_id: version}`` map, not an opaque handle).

A protocol proof bounds the REGISTRY, not the integration: ``Snapshot.tla`` proves
``NoReadSkewWithinCut`` / ``PinAlwaysRetained`` over the model; this file is the
integration-layer regression for the multi-read capture WINDOW. Per the
split-comparand learning the staleness probes use **fixed-stale buffers, not
counters** — a captured cut compared against a buffer literal, never a re-derived
expectation that could drift with the bug it is meant to catch.

Reason matching is ALWAYS ``reason == CONSTANT`` against the imported wire-stable
constant — never a substring of a human message (the typed-signal-not-substring
house rule).
