"""A denied read inside a peer's commit→disk window must not hand out a comparand.

A peer's ``write_cas_at`` confirms its CAS at the coordinator and only THEN
writes its bytes to disk. A read that lands between the two sees the OLD bytes
on disk while the coordinator already reports the NEW version, and under strict
mode the coordinator denies it with ``hash_differs``. Handing that pair back as
``(bytes, version)`` is a split comparand: the caller derives from the old
bytes, passes the new version to ``write_cas_at``, and by the time the CAS runs
the peer's disk write has landed, so the version check passes and the peer's
update is overwritten.

The window is forced here rather than raced: the peer's ``_atomic_write`` waits
on an event the test releases, so every test below reads INSIDE the window.
