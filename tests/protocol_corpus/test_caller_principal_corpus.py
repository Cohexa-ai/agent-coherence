"""Caller-principal corpus: the route posture across the two runtimes (plan U6).

Only the Python coordinator mints a caller principal and enforces the route
posture; the sibling Node coordinator answers 404 on ``/principal/claim`` and
ignores the header (KTD12). This module pins that asymmetry the way the
effect-fence corpus pins a route one implementation lacks: node-only rows
record what Node does, Python-only rows what Python does, and both-backend rows
assert only what the two agree on.

What a principal buys is accident-resistance and attributability under the
same-OS-user cooperative trust model. On the hook surface the principal is
stored under ``.coherence/``, so there it is convention-enforcement and a
detectable unbound caller, never separation between callers.

Also here, because they need the built sibling: the harness's backend-scoped
preflight (the capability those rows are written in), and the cross-runtime
client check — the Node hook client obtains its principal from the PYTHON
coordinator and its commit is attributed to its session, and the Python hook
client presents the principal the Node client stored.

Marked ``protocol_corpus`` — opt-in via ``pytest -m protocol_corpus``. A Node
row that cannot run FAILS rather than xfails: an unrun asymmetry row reports
green while checking nothing."""
