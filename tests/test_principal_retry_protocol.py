"""The caller-principal retry protocol, pinned ONCE for both long-lived clients.

``CoherentVolume`` and ``SubstrateCoordinatorSession`` each carry their own
copy of what a request refused for its caller principal does: send once; on a
typed ``caller_principal_*`` refusal claim again with the session's SAME mint
nonce; adopt a principal that differs from the one presented and retry the
request exactly ONCE; a 404 on the claim retries once without the header;
anything the claim cannot cure raises the typed ``CallerPrincipalRefused``,
and a refused retry is reported under the RETRY's reason. The two copies are
deliberate — #250 tracks extracting one helper — so this module drives both
classes through ONE scripted refuse/recover/retry matrix over the wire (a
loopback coordinator answering from a script; nothing is spawned or stubbed
below the public API) and asserts every row identically on:

1. every POST, in order — the request route, ``/principal/claim``, and nothing
   else — so a second claim, a third send, or a send that never went out fails;
2. the ``Coherence-Caller-Principal`` header each request POST presented — the
   held one first, the recovered one on the retry, none after a 404;
3. the outcome — the 2xx answer consumed, or ``CallerPrincipalRefused`` with
   the exact typed reason and the exact message.

Every expectation is a hand-written duplicate of the documented protocol and
its constants; nothing is derived from the code under test, so a reworded
constant or a re-ordered send turns a row red and becomes a decision. The one
intended difference between the copies is pinned at the bottom, on its own.

Principals and the mint nonce are asserted by token — the held one, the
recovered one, the attach nonce — so a row that fails prints which one a POST
carried and never a value; the leak check names what leaked, not what it was.
That holds on every failure path, under pytest's default flags and under
``-l``: whatever the client lets out, its typed error or a crash, is kept as a
value (:class:`_Ran`), leak-checked FIRST, and a crash is then reported by
type and location only, without a traceback — a traceback entry prints the
arguments of its frame, and on the claim path the nonce is one; and no
test-frame local ever holds a principal or the nonce (they live in the
:class:`_Script`, whose repr names counts), so a dump of locals prints tokens.
