"""NoZombieRevoke — the read-generation fence as an OPERATION-CLASS property.

Regression suite for two defects in the grant-revoking path, both reproduced
single-host, in one process, under the registry ``RLock``. The shape is the one
Temporal closed in their semaphore pattern with signal pinning: "a late release
Signal from a holder whose lease already expired could revoke a subsequent
acquirer's permit".

The fence (``owner_generation`` vs a committer's captured ``read_generation``)
was checked on the three COMMIT paths only — ``commit_cas``, ``commit_all`` and
``set_artifact_and_content(fence_agent_id=…)`` — and neither checked nor
maintained by the other grant-revoking operation, ``invalidate``:

F1 — ZOMBIE REVOKE. ``CoordinatorService.invalidate`` revoked whatever grant it
     named with no validation at all, so a signal minted at one epoch destroyed
     a grant established at a later one. Fixed by pinning a PEER-issued
     invalidation to the target's ``last_observed_version``
     (``service._revoke_is_superseded``).

F2 — FENCE SUPPRESSION. ``invalidate`` moved an M/E holder to INVALID with
     ``trigger="invalidate"``, which was not in ``RECLAIM_TRIGGERS``, so
     ``owner_generation`` did not bump — and the sweep could never arm the fence
     afterwards, there being no M/E grant left to reclaim. Identical end-state,
     opposite verdict. Fixed by ``EPOCH_BUMP_TRIGGERS``.

The last two tests pin the guards that keep F1's fix from over-reaching:
dropping an invalidation is far more dangerous than applying one.

# single caller: ``enforce_stable_grant_timeouts`` reads the state map, the
# transient slot, the heartbeat and ``granted_at_tick`` in four separate
# registry calls, then writes INVALID in a fifth. Nothing holds those five
# together on EITHER backend: sqlite serializes each call on its RLock, but
# the sequence lives in the service layer, above any per-call lock. Both arms
# fail here today, and both must pass once the sweep decides and writes in
# one hold (the plan's U5).
#
# The GIL switch interval is forced down for the racing test: at the 5 ms
# default a ~100-bytecode window between two registry calls is practically
# never split, and the failure this test exists to show goes quiet. At 1 us
# it reproduces in well over half the rounds on both arms (measured: 92-137
# warnings per run in-memory, 9-19 on sqlite), which over 40 rounds puts a

    """A grant renewed at a fresh tick is not reclaimed by a concurrent sweep.

    R9 / AE1. Two windows open inside ``enforce_stable_grant_timeouts``, both
    between a read and the write that acts on it, with no lock holding the
    pair together:

      W1  the sweep reads ``granted_at_tick`` (or the heartbeat) while the
          grant is still the original over-held one, decides reclaim, and by
          the time it writes INVALID the holder has renewed. A grant that was
          fresh at write time is destroyed on a budget it no longer had.
          Proven reachable by a forced interleave (park the sweep inside
          ``last_heartbeat_tick``, heartbeat, release: the reclaim lands on a
          holder that just proved it was alive); a few-bytecode window, so
          racing alone never hit it in 160 measured rounds. The final-state
          assertion below is its regression net.

      W2  the sweep's snapshot sees M/E, then the renewal's release pops the
          ``granted_at_tick`` slot before the sweep reads it. The sweep finds
          an M/E holder with no grant tick -- a state the registry's own
          comment says "should not exist" -- logs it, and SKIPS the max-hold
          check for that holder: enforcement quietly not happening. This is
          the wide window; it is what reliably fails this test today, on both
          arms. The warning assertion below is its discriminator.

    The discriminator for W1 needs no timing heuristic. The renewer's LAST act
    in every round is an acquire, so if the holder is INVALID once both threads
    have joined, the sweep's write necessarily landed after that acquire. A
    sweep that reclaims the original stale grant BEFORE the first renewal is
    correct, and leaves the holder M/E via the renewal that follows -- so it is
    not counted, and the assertion cannot fire on a legitimate reclaim.

    Runs many rounds because both windows are genuine races, not gated ones: a
    gate inside the sweep's read-to-write window would deadlock against the
    very lock this test exists to justify -- and after the fix the gated
    interleave is exactly the schedule the lock makes unreachable.
