"""NoZombieRevoke — the read-generation fence as an OPERATION-CLASS property.

Regression suite for two defects in the grant-revoking path, both reproduced
single-host, in one process, under the registry ``RLock``. The shape is the one
Temporal closed in their semaphore pattern with signal pinning: "a late release
Signal from a holder whose lease already expired could revoke a subsequent
acquirer's permit".

The fence (``owner_generation`` vs a committer's captured ``read_generation``)
was checked on the three COMMIT paths only — ``commit_cas``, ``commit_all`` and
``set_artifact_and_content(fence_agent_id=…)`` — and neither checked nor
maintained by the other grant-revoking operation, ``invalidate``:

F1 — ZOMBIE REVOKE. ``CoordinatorService.invalidate`` revoked whatever grant it
     named with no validation at all, so a signal minted at one epoch destroyed
     a grant established at a later one. Fixed by pinning a PEER-issued
     invalidation to the target's ``last_observed_version``
     (``service._revoke_is_superseded``).

F2 — FENCE SUPPRESSION. ``invalidate`` moved an M/E holder to INVALID with
     ``trigger="invalidate"``, which was not in ``RECLAIM_TRIGGERS``, so
     ``owner_generation`` did not bump — and the sweep could never arm the fence
     afterwards, there being no M/E grant left to reclaim. Identical end-state,
     opposite verdict. Fixed by ``EPOCH_BUMP_TRIGGERS``.

The last two tests pin the guards that keep F1's fix from over-reaching:
dropping an invalidation is far more dangerous than applying one.

            broadcast to P is HELD on the bus
      t2    Q registers (joined after the mint: not a recipient, cache cold)
      t200  the sweep reclaims W (no heartbeat)    -> W INVALID, epoch 1, v2
      rel   the held broadcast lands on P; P's ``handle_update`` writer leg
            re-grants W SHARED with ``"update"``   -> W.rg 0 < epoch 1
      t201  Q reads                                -> cache cold, reaches

    registry captured epoch 1 for W, and t202 landed with ZERO fetches — a
    claim the fence had refused, cleared because someone else read.

    Why a deferred bus: with the default synchronous ``InMemoryEventBus`` the
    broadcast is delivered inside W's own ``write`` call, so W is downgraded
    M -> SHARED before it ever returns, and there is no M/E grant left for a
    sweep to reclaim — the state cannot be reached. Why Q, not P, is the
    fetcher: the released broadcast leaves P holding a SHARED cache entry at
    v2, and under the eager strategy a SHARED entry is a cache hit
    (``requires_refresh`` only on INVALID), so P's read never reaches the
    coordinator. Neither is a second assertion path; both are why the
    choreography is shaped as it is.

      W1  the sweep reads ``granted_at_tick`` (or the heartbeat) while the
          grant is still the original over-held one, decides reclaim, and by
          the time it writes INVALID the holder has renewed. A grant that was
          fresh at write time is destroyed on a budget it no longer had.
          Proven reachable by a forced interleave (park the sweep inside
          ``last_heartbeat_tick``, heartbeat, release: the reclaim lands on a
          holder that just proved it was alive); a few-bytecode window, so
          racing alone never hit it in 160 measured rounds. The final-state
          assertion below is its regression net.

      W2  the sweep's snapshot sees M/E, then the renewal's release pops the
          ``granted_at_tick`` slot before the sweep reads it. The sweep finds
          an M/E holder with no grant tick -- a state the registry's own
          comment says "should not exist" -- logs it, and SKIPS the max-hold
          check for that holder: enforcement quietly not happening. This is
          the wide window; it is what reliably fails this test today, on both
          arms. The warning assertion below is its discriminator.

    The discriminator for W1 needs no timing heuristic. The renewer's LAST act
    in every round is an acquire, so if the holder is INVALID once both threads
    have joined, the sweep's write necessarily landed after that acquire. A
    sweep that reclaims the original stale grant BEFORE the first renewal is
    correct, and leaves the holder M/E via the renewal that follows -- so it is
    not counted, and the assertion cannot fire on a legitimate reclaim.

    Runs many rounds because both windows are genuine races, not gated ones: a
    gate inside the sweep's read-to-write window would deadlock against the
    very lock this test exists to justify -- and after the fix the gated
    interleave is exactly the schedule the lock makes unreachable.

# publish-after-lock window the F1 test proves for invalidations exists for
# updates, and a stale update did three wrong things at once — regressed the
# recipient's view to older bytes marked valid (under the zero-staleness
# eager strategy), dropped a fresher M/E claim to SHARED with no epoch bump,
# and let ``set_agent_state`` stamp ``last_observed_version`` with the
# registry's CURRENT version while the cache held the OLDER body, poisoning
# the exact comparand ``_revoke_is_superseded`` trusts. The guard compares
# the broadcast's version against the registry's current version under one
# hold and skips the whole apply when it is behind — keeping only the
# transient clear, because a stranded transient stalls the sweep while an
# early clear is harmless. The fresh path is pinned by
# ``test_eager_update_then_declined_invalidation_leaves_no_transient``.
