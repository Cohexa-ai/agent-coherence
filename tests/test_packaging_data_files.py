"""Guard: every non-Python asset under ``src/ccs/`` ships in the distribution.

``ccs/output/report.py`` and ``ccs/diagnose/render.py`` read their HTML
templates off the filesystem next to the module. Nothing in the import system
notices when such a file is missing from the wheel — the failure surfaces only
at render time, in the installed-from-PyPI environment, as a bare
``FileNotFoundError``. The repo's own test run never sees it, because a source
checkout always has the file.

So this module asserts the packaging *declaration* instead of the built
artifact: it replays setuptools' own ``build_py.find_data_files`` algorithm
against ``pyproject.toml`` and fails if any asset in the tree is left
undeclared. That runs in a plain ``pytest -q`` with no wheel build and no
setuptools import; ``test_replayed_data_files_match_setuptools`` pins the
replay to the real backend wherever setuptools happens to be importable.
