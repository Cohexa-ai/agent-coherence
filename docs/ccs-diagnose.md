# `ccs-diagnose` — detect stale reads in your LangGraph graph

`ccs-diagnose` attaches a passive callback to an existing LangGraph graph and classifies its write pattern (`single_writer` / `shared_artifact` / `parallel_branch` / `mixed_pattern` / `insufficient`). It reports artifacts whose reads were handed divergent versions across nodes — divergence the runtime is already producing but never surfaces.

It runs as a **witness-quality** surface: it observes what the runtime *handed* a node, not what the node read. Upgrading to `CCSStore` lifts these observations into provable per-key attribution — same diagnose surface, no callback rewiring.

**`ccs-diagnose` is detection only — it enforces nothing.** It surfaces divergence; it never denies a read or a write. What *closes* a divergence once you've seen it depends on which side the race is on:

- **Read-side drift** (a peer committed a new version, your cached view went stale) → **CCSStore** provides read-side coherence: when a peer commits a new version, your cached view is invalidated so your next read is a fresh miss. It does not deny a stale write-back — `put` is not version-CAS.
- **Write-side lost-update** (a stale writer overwriting a peer) → route writes through **CoherentVolume** or **`write_cas`**.

**Scope:** `ccs-diagnose` observes a single in-process run — the versions the runtime hands nodes inside one process. Divergence that happens across separate OS processes (two hosts, or two processes over shared files) is invisible to it; for cross-process coordination over files, reach for CoherentVolume.

The CLI makes **zero outbound network requests** in v0.

## Install

```bash
pip install "agent-coherence[diagnose]"
```

## Quick start

```bash
ccs-diagnose --graph path/to/your_graph.py:build_graph

# Or run it right now against the bundled example graph — no setup:
ccs-diagnose --graph examples/langgraph_planner/main.py:build_graph_no_store
```

The factory must accept zero arguments (or accept an initial state file via `--state-file`) and return a compiled LangGraph graph. The CLI runs the graph once with a passive observer and writes two reports:

| Output | Default path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| HTML report | `diagnose_report.html` | Human-readable: classification verdict, divergence witnesses, tracked-artifacts panel, cost extrapolation, CTA |
| JSON report | `diagnose_report.json` | Machine-readable: full schema for piping into `jq`, dashboards, or `--show-payload` re-rendering |

## Common invocations

```bash
# Basic — run the pipeline and write both reports
ccs-diagnose --graph my_graph.py:build_graph

# Pass an initial state
ccs-diagnose --graph my_graph.py:build_graph --state-file initial_state.json

# Cost extrapolation (interactions per hour)
ccs-diagnose --graph my_graph.py:build_graph --volume 50

# Pipe JSON straight into jq (summary goes to stderr)
ccs-diagnose --graph my_graph.py:build_graph --output-json - | jq .verdict

# Re-render a previously emitted report without re-running the graph
ccs-diagnose --show-payload diagnose_report.json

# Strict mode — promote sequential-staleness exclusions back into the headline
ccs-diagnose --graph my_graph.py:build_graph --strict

# Restrict tracked keys
ccs-diagnose --graph my_graph.py:build_graph --ignore tmp_buf,debug_trace --track shared_doc

# Calibration corpus — appends a single payload entry to a local JSONL file
ccs-diagnose --graph my_graph.py:build_graph --calibration-record

# Non-TTY agent invocations (consent prompt would otherwise block)
ccs-diagnose --graph my_graph.py:build_graph --yes
```

## Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--graph PATH:FUNCTION` | Path + factory name; required for the main pipeline |
| `--state-file PATH` | JSON or YAML file passed to `graph.invoke()` |
| `--output-html PATH` | HTML output (default: `diagnose_report.html`) |
| `--output-json PATH` | JSON output (default: `diagnose_report.json`; `-` for stdout) |
| `--no-json` | Suppress JSON output |
| `--volume N` | Interactions per hour for annualized cost extrapolation |
| `--lead-pain-type {cost,auditability,auto}` | Which secondary KPI rides the headline |
| `--cost-per-1k-tokens FLOAT` | Token cost assumption for extrapolation |
| `--strict` | Promote sequential-staleness exclusions back into the headline count |
| `--ignore KEY1,KEY2` | State keys to skip (supports `__`-prefixed) |
| `--track KEY1,KEY2` | Force-track keys (wins over `--ignore`) |
| `--warm-lead` | Switch the CTA to a warm-conversation 2-question seed |
| `--book-a-call-url URL` | Override CTA calendar URL (also: `CCS_DIAGNOSE_BOOK_A_CALL_URL`) |
| `--contact-email EMAIL` | Override CTA reply-to (also: `CCS_DIAGNOSE_CONTACT_EMAIL`) |
| `--show-payload PATH` | Re-render a previously emitted `report.json`; bypasses graph load |
| `--dry-run` | Print the payload that would be submitted (v0 has no network code) |
| `--no-network` / `--no-telemetry` | Suppress consent prompt and calibration write |
| `--yes` / `--non-interactive` | Skip consent prompt (required for non-TTY agent invocations) |
| `--calibration-record [PATH]` | Append payload to local JSONL calibration corpus |
| `--reset-token` | Regenerate the local installation token |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Generic error (graph load failure, JSON parse, etc.) |
| `2` | Usage error (argparse, mutually exclusive flags, bad URL/email) |
| `3` | Dependency missing (import error from graph or extras) |
| `4` | Schema mismatch (`--show-payload` version not supported) |
| `5` | I/O error (write/read failed; oversized input file) |

## Trust posture

`ccs-diagnose` makes **zero outbound network requests** in v0. The HTML renderer uses Jinja2 with `select_autoescape`. The `--book-a-call-url` and `--contact-email` values are validated against an allowlist that rejects `javascript:`, `data:`, and `vbscript:` schemes (the same allowlist guards the `CCS_DIAGNOSE_BOOK_A_CALL_URL` / `CCS_DIAGNOSE_CONTACT_EMAIL` env-var overrides).

Three independent kill switches suppress all telemetry-shaped output (no consent prompt, no calibration write, no payload generation):

- `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` (cross-tool consensus per consoledonottrack.com)
- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`
- `CCS_DIAGNOSE_NO_TELEMETRY=1`

`--no-telemetry` and `--no-network` are the per-invocation equivalents.

See [security.md](security.md) for the full trust contract, supply-chain threat model, and attestation-verification commands.

## Calibration corpus

The `--calibration-record` flag appends one entry per run to a local JSONL file at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ccs-diagnose/calibration.jsonl` (or `~/.local/share/ccs-diagnose/calibration.jsonl` when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset). The file is mode `0600`. Override the path with `--calibration-record /tmp/my_calibration.jsonl`.

Each entry contains:

- Stack name and version (e.g., `LangGraph 1.1.10`)
- Classifier verdict + confidence
- Coverage shape (counts only — no key names, no content, no hashes)
- Timestamp
- Schema version + sequence number + instance ID

Nothing else. The file is `validate_log`-compatible:

```bash
python -c "from ccs.validation import validate_log; \
    print(validate_log('$XDG_DATA_HOME/ccs-diagnose/calibration.jsonl', \
                       schema_version='ccs.diagnose.v0-preview'))"
```

A clean file returns `([], [])` — empty gap and schema-mismatch lists.

The append is gated by consent: runs without granted consent (or with `DO_NOT_TRACK` / `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` / `CCS_DIAGNOSE_NO_TELEMETRY` set, or `--no-telemetry` / `--no-network` passed) print a skip message and exit `0` without touching the file.

## Promotion to `langgraph-v1`

`ccs-diagnose` ships under the `langgraph-v0-preview` classifier. Submissions tagged `v0-preview` are excluded from the public benchmark — they accumulate in the local JSONL file you can share back with us to contribute to v1 promotion.

The `v0-preview` → `v1` promotion gate requires:

1. **>= 5 real production graphs** validated across **>= 3 distinct supervisor topologies**
2. The Tracked-Artifacts panel produces **zero unknown `__`-prefix surprises** on a current LangGraph release
3. The append-only prefix-stability rule survives a workload that **compacts message history mid-run** (real-world `trim_messages` pattern)

Once promoted, `v1`-tagged submissions populate the public benchmark; `v0-preview` calibration data is not retroactively migrated.

## Sharing calibration data

DM `vlad@agent-coherence.dev` (or open an issue on the repo) with your `calibration.jsonl` contents. Nothing is collected that isn't documented above; you can read every field before sharing.
